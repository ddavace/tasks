This is my personal fork of the Tasks app.  You almost certainly want to go here instead: (https://github.com/tasks/tasks)  

Astrid was a popular cross-platform productivity service that was [acquired](https://web.archive.org/web/20130811052500/http://blog.astrid.com/blog/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-astrid/) and [discontinued](https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/06/astrid-goes-dark-august-5-goodnight-sweet-squid/) in 2013. The source code from Astrid's open source Android app serves as the basis of Tasks.
